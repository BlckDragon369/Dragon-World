# Hello-World
Working on a Discord Bot, that searches internet for pics, plays music, purges texts, and more.
Im getting used to this learning the basics.
My goal is to make one bot for discord that does everything i need it to do. 
I want the bot to search music to play on discord.
Search pictures from the internet.
Purge messages in bulk from all to certain people on discord. 
Play games with it on discord.
To have a conversation with it on discord. And do much more.
These are the basics I would like to do for now though.
